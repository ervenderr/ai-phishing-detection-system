# Sprint 3: Link & Domain Analysis - Summary

## Accomplishments

In Sprint 3, we have successfully implemented the Link & Domain Analysis component of our AI-Powered Phishing Detection System. This has significantly enhanced our system's ability to detect phishing attempts by analyzing URLs and domains found in emails.

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Link Extraction and Analysis**

   - Created a robust URL extraction mechanism to identify all URLs in email content
   - Implemented comprehensive URL analysis to detect suspicious links

2. **Integration with Security APIs**

   - **VirusTotal API**: Implemented URL scanning to check against 70+ security vendors
   - **AbuseIPDB API**: Added domain reputation checking to identify domains associated with abuse
   - **WhoisXML API**: Built domain age verification to flag newly created domains (common in phishing)

3. **Risk Score Calculation**

   - Developed a sophisticated algorithm to calculate risk scores (0-100) based on multiple factors:
     - Security vendor detections from VirusTotal (0-50 points)
     - Domain reputation from AbuseIPDB (0-25 points)
     - Domain age from WhoisXML API (0-25 points)

4. **API Endpoints**

   - Created `/analyze-url` endpoint for individual URL analysis
   - Implemented `/analyze-links` endpoint to scan text for URLs
   - Added `/set-api-keys` endpoint for API key configuration
   - Enhanced existing `/scan-email` endpoint to incorporate link analysis

5. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation for the Link Analysis module
   - Provided detailed API key setup instructions
   - Included testing procedures and usage examples

## Technical Implementation

The Link & Domain Analysis module has been implemented as a class-based system in Python, making it easy to maintain and extend. The primary components are:

- **LinkAnalyzer Class**: The main class for analyzing URLs and text content
- **URL Extraction**: Regular expression-based URL extraction from text
- **API Integrations**: Modular functions for each external API
- **Risk Scoring**: Configurable algorithm for risk assessment

## Testing

We have created a comprehensive test script (`test_link_analyzer.py`) that verifies:

- URL extraction from text
- Single URL analysis with all integrated APIs
- Text analysis to extract and analyze multiple URLs
- API key configuration and validation

## Integration with ML Model

The Link Analysis module has been integrated with our existing ML model, combining both analysis methods to provide a more robust phishing detection system:

- Text content is analyzed by our ML model
- URLs are analyzed by the Link Analysis module
- Results are combined to produce a unified verdict

## Next Steps

With the completion of the Link & Domain Analysis module, we are now ready to move to Sprint 4: Verdict Engine & Alert System. The Verdict Engine will combine all the analysis results to produce a final phishing verdict, and the Alert System will notify users of potential threats.

## API Usage Examples

```python
# Single URL analysis
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/analyze-url",
    json={"url": "https://example.com/login"}
)

# Text analysis
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/analyze-links",
    json={"text": "Please check this link: https://example.com/verify.php"}
)

# Enhanced email scan
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/scan-email",
    json={
        "subject": "Urgent: Verify Your Account",
        "sender": "security@bank.com",
        "recipient": "user@example.com",
        "body": "Click here to verify: https://bank-secure.com/verify.php"
    }
)
```
